# Tuist iOS Example

This is an example project demonstrating how to use the `cargo-xcframework` plugin with a Tuist generated iOS project.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Tuist**: If you haven't already, first [install Tuist](https://docs.tuist.io/guide/introduction/installation.html#installation).
2. **Build and Run**: Use the `tuist run TuistIos` command, just like `cargo run`. Cool, right?
